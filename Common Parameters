Common Hyperparameters:
fit_intercept: if we want to calculate intercept for the model, and is not required if data is centered.
normalize: X will be normalised by substracting mean and dividing by SD

Common Attributes:
coefficients are the weights for each independent variable.
intercept is the bias of indep term of linear models.

Common functions:
fit: trains the model.Takes X & Y as the input value and trains the model.
predict:once the mmodel is trained,for given X using predict fn Y can be predicted.

Training Model:
X should be in rows of data format, X.ndim==2
Y should be 1D for single target & 2D for more than 2 target
fit fn is used for training the model.
